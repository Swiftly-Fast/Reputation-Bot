        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <img src="banner.png" alt="Reputation Bot Banner">
        <p class="details">Reputation Bot was developed with a singular purpose: to enhance user engagement in Discord communities. Our team of dedicated developers and community managers understands the need for fostering positive interactions among users, and we have poured our passion and expertise into creating a bot that is not only functional but also a joy to use. We recognize that a vibrant community is built on meaningful interactions, and that's why we are committed to providing a tool that empowers users to connect, appreciate, and recognize each other.</p>

        <p class="details">Our journey began when we identified a gap in the tools available for community managers.
